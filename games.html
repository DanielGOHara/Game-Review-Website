        <span>A brilliant shooter which mix's up gameplay with the involvement of titans. The change of gameplay
          from these makes the gameplay interesting and fun with the tide of the game being able to change at anytime. In terms of
          graphics the game is massively ahead of its time with the game looking phenomenal, with optimisation
          being on point even with weaker computer hardware. Defiantly a game I see myself sinking hours into.</span>
