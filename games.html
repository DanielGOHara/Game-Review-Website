                <span class = "gameDescription" id = "gameReviewDescription">Titanfall 2 is a first-person shooter video game,
                                              developed by Respawn Entertainment and published
                                              by Electronic Arts. A sequel to 2014's Titanfall,
                                              the game was released worldwide on October 28,
                                              2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</span>

        <span>A brilliant shooter which mix's up gameplay with the involvement of titans. The change of gameplay
          from these makes the gameplay interesting and fun with the tide of the game being able to change at anytime. In terms of
          graphics the game is massively ahead of its time with the game looking phenomenal, with optimisation
          being on point even with weaker computer hardware. Defiantly a game I see myself sinking hours into.</span>
